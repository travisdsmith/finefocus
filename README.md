# FineFocus.org CMS
Fine Focus is a microbiology journal associate with Ball State University that I worked with my senior year of college.
This is a custom Content Management System (CMS) that I built to satisfy the needs of the journal.

In addition to a website that provides visitors with information about the journal, the custom CMS also includes:
 - Functionality to update page content
 - Ability to manage pictures and slideshows
 - A page for visitors to request a copy of the journal, as well as the ability for Fine Focus students to fulfill requests
 - Capability to manage data, such as experts and journal contacts
 - User management, so accounts can be issues and revoked from students with each semester

Since I completed this project, their needs have changed and they have moved to a web platform provided by Ball State University.
An archived demonstration (with fake data) is available [here](http://travisdsmith.com/demo.php?name=finefocus).
